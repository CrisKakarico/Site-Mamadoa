        Hey! I'm an independent developer, and you can call me Cris. I've worked with programming since I was a kid, I've always liked games, and when I was only 8-10 I started with simple languages, like the block language in construct 2, but over time I got to know other engines, like Unity (this is my favorite engine until today), so I learned C# (on the internet) and made some games, and I liked that so I started working with Python, making programs, and then I saw HTML and CSS, and I thought, "I need to make a website!", so I did some sites, and I thought it was cool, and that's basically my programming story. I haven't released any games on stean or on the play store yet, but I intend to release a game from the Backrooms that I'm making, it's already in a good phase of development, and it just needs some details like bugs, more enemies, map expansion and some other things. I believe that by 2023 I will have released the beta. I learned the batch/cmd language, but I don't know if it counts well as a language, I managed to make several simple programs, and even an RPG game where you write the actions, and everything ran through the prompt and even had music, which I only I managed to add thanks to vbs, which is another programming "language" that I learned quite a bit. I intend to work as a programmer and/or musician (I have a youtube channel where I post my songs, if you want to help: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIYNRVArh9l-ZoCE3ojISIg"> https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIYNRVArh9l-ZoCE3ojISIg </a>), and I intend to work mainly with programming AI. NOTE: I made this site in 3 days, so the site probably has some errors and crashes, but I'll fix that later.
